## Engine management

### Which system to use

Q: Which engine management systems are most commonly installed to handle the fuel requirements of a boosted 5VZ-FE engine?


A: One of the most common piggyback engine management systems used for turbocharged Toyota 5VZ-FE engines is the AEM F/IC (Fuel/Ignition Controller). This system allows for additional fuel and ignition timing control to accommodate the increased demands of forced induction. It's popular due to its compatibility with a wide range of vehicles and its ability to work alongside the stock ECU without requiring a full standalone engine management system. 

Other options include the Apexi SAFC (Super Air Flow Converter) and the GReddy e-Manage. However, the choice ultimately depends on specific needs, preferences, and compatibility with the vehicle's setup. It's always advisable to consult with experienced tuners or professionals familiar with turbocharging setups for tailored recommendations.

Q: How does AEM's ECU piggyback system work in conjunction with the engine's factory-installed computer?

Does AEM's controller function by tricking the factory-installed computer into thinking that conditions are normal?

A: The AEM F/IC (Fuel/Ignition Controller) is a piggyback engine management system designed to work alongside the factory ECU rather than replacing it entirely. It doesn't necessarily "trick" the factory ECU into thinking conditions are normal, but rather it intercepts and modifies signals sent between the engine sensors and the ECU to adjust fuel and ignition timing.

Here's a basic overview of how the AEM F/IC typically works:

1. Intercepting Signals: The F/IC intercepts signals from various engine sensors such as the airflow meter, throttle position sensor, manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor, and engine coolant temperature sensor.

2. Modifying Signals: Once intercepted, the F/IC modifies these signals to adjust fuel delivery and ignition timing according to the parameters set by the user via its tuning software.

3. Sending Modified Signals: The modified signals are then sent to the factory ECU, which interprets them as the correct parameters for fuel delivery and ignition timing.

4. Coordinating with the Factory ECU: The factory ECU still retains control over certain engine functions, such as idle speed control and emissions systems, while the F/IC focuses on fuel and ignition adjustments related to forced induction.

5. Fine-Tuning: Users can fine-tune fuel and ignition maps using the F/IC's tuning software to optimize engine performance and ensure safe operation under boosted conditions.

Overall, the AEM F/IC works in tandem with the factory ECU to provide additional control over fuel and ignition parameters, allowing for proper tuning and optimization of a turbocharged engine without the need for a full standalone engine management system.
